# Fire prediction - Bosnia & Herzegovina

Implementation of logistic regression use in fire prediction over territory of Bosnia & Herzegovina.

Sample dataset created using NASA GSFC Giovanni web application (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) in the form of daily area-averaged time series in period of 31.7.2010 to 31.7.2020, itâ€™s analyzed and preprocessed before it is used as input for logit model. 

Two features left for implementation: 
- independent variable statistic tests
- input validation

It's UWP based application created using Visual Studio 2019.
